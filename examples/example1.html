            Haml is usually indented with two spaces,
            although more than two is allowed.
            You have to be consistent, though.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first character of any line is called
            the "control character" - it says "make a tag"
            or "run Common Lisp code" or all sorts of things.
          </li>
        </ul>

          This example doesn't allow Common Lisp to be executed,
          but real CL-HAML does.
        </p>

          Common Lisp code is included by using = at the
